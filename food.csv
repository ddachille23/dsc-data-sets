Shortcut Cooking From Jamie Oliver,Front Burner,"Clever cookbooks with a limited number of ingredients per recipe are not new, but this one from the chef Jamie Oliver is notable for its ease and verve. Before he gets to the cooking he names his five “pantry heroes”: red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper and two olive oils, everyday and finer for finishing, staples that are not part of the ingredient tally. The book starts with salads, mostly as the center of the plate, and then goes on to simple pastas like one with canned tuna, capers and tiny tomatoes. There are sections on eggs, chicken, fish, various meats (beef dishes are mostly steaks) and desserts. To keep the ingredient count to five, Mr. Oliver bakes with self-rising flour and premade puff pastry and relies on prepared Asian condiments and sauces. With coconut milk and curry paste, you’re on your way to soup. Along with plenty of inspiring shortcuts, there’s a straightforward recipe for potato gnocchi with asparagus, and a six-hour lamb shoulder baked with chickpeas from scratch, not quick at all.",2019-01-07 15:46:46+00:00,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Oliver, Jamie', '5 Ingredients: Quick & Easy Food (Book)']"

The dish for which Mr. Arellano, 24, is best known at his compact market stall is braised beef noodle soup, a Taiwanese specialty. It comes in a deep bowl filled with slices of beef, bok choy, pickled cabbage and his hand-pulled noodles, an art that he has managed to perfect.

Cedric Vongerichten, 37, the son of the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, has opened a restaurant blending Asia and France, just as his father did. When it comes to Asia, the younger Mr. Vongerichten looks not to Thailand, but to Indonesia, the home country of his wife, Ochi Vongerichten, a partner in the venture. This is his first independent move; he is still the executive chef at the West Village restaurant Perry St., owned by his father’s company. So the name, Wayan, meaning “first-born” in Bali, is fitting. The front of the restaurant has a marble bar, whitewashed brick walls and a few tables. In a passageway to the main dining room in the rear is a shelf with a display of spices used in Indonesian cooking, like long pepper and turmeric root. There’s greenery throughout for a tropical feel, and the design, by Rockwell Group, includes custom Indonesian decorations. Mr. Vongerichten describes the food, most of it served family-style, as coming from a mixture of cultures, using French techniques to interpret Indonesian classics. There’s avocado and a peanut relish instead of spicy peanut sauce on his gado gado, and a rustic cabbage and egg dish; he is using less of the funky shrimp paste that is ubiquitous in Indonesia.

Ms. Nguyen says that Vietnamese cooking can also be adapted using commonplace foods. Standout recipes include lettuce wraps, smashed cucumbers with shrimp, and oven-steamed egg custards similar to Japanese chawanmushi. Using coconut milk to make a corn bisque is particularly inspired.

Overproofed Gin for Your Martini,Front Burner,"Navy-strength describes a category of gin that’s overproof, that is, more than the standard 40 percent alcohol for most spirits (and sometimes more than 50 percent). “But why Navy?” you may ask as you sip your gin and tonic. In the British Navy, the shipboard gin supplies traditionally included casks, usually from sherry-making, that held high-proof gin reserved for officers. If gin (or rum) could ignite gunpowder, it gave “proof” that it was not diluted, and had to be at least 57 percent alcohol. Simon Ford, who makes Fords Gin, has now introduced his Officers’ Reserve, a Navy-strength gin at 54.5 percent alcohol. Like Fords Gin, it’s London-style, dry and infused with classic botanicals and spices, like juniper, which impart subtle flavor. The alcohol gives it heat, which can be tempered with ice and a splash of lime and good tonic water.

Steelhead Trout From the Hudson Valley,Front Burner,"If you’re dining on the West Coast, steelhead is likely to be familiar. Not so much in the East until very recently, when farm-raised steelhead started showing up. The delicious salmonlike fish is native to the waters off California, Oregon and Washington. It’s essentially a robust rainbow trout that has spawned in fresh water rivers and streams but then, like salmon, has gone out to sea, where it grows bigger, with typically orange-red flesh. In the wild, it is a federally protected species, with a regulated commercial fishery. There is some recreational steelhead fishing in New York State and the surrounding areas because rainbow trout was introduced from the West about 150 years ago. Now steelhead is being farmed in an indoor facility upstate, Hudson Valley Fisheries, where it can reach nearly seven pounds and is raised without hormones, antibiotics and parasiticides. Chefs have started using it, and it’s sold for home cooks. Prepare it like salmon; it’s rich in both flavor and texture.",2019-03-18 22:51:19+00:00,"['Trout', 'Seafood', 'Fishing, Commercial', 'Fairway Supermarkets', 'Hudson River Valley (NY)', 'Hudson Valley Fisheries']"

It’s on the ground floor of an Art Deco tower that was the headquarters of the insurance giant AIG, in a space that was at one time to house a restaurant from Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield. Now the building’s co-owners and managers, Rose Associates, have brought in this new team. The restaurant, an airy space with high ceilings in ivory and butterscotch, has two dining areas, with the kitchen, an immense stainless-steel island, to one side.

Though Mr. Bouchait — a master cheesemaker based in southwest France — focuses on the 45 French cheeses that have government-controlled names, his broad scope includes types of milk, raw and pasteurized cheeses, ripening, storage, fat content, wine pairings (he prefers white) and 40 recipes.",2019-04-01 23:05:39+00:00,"['Cheese', 'Books and Literature', 'Bouchait, Dominique', ""Fromages: An Expert's Guide to French Cheese (Book)""]"

Stylish Cafeteria From Dean & DeLuca Opens in the Meatpacking District,,"This new cafeteria restaurant from Dean & DeLuca, on the street level of the former Spice Market building, has been under development for nearly three years. Sorapoj Techakraisri, who expanded the company’s presence into Asia and the Middle East, is spearheading the venture. (His Pace Development, based in Bangkok, bought Dean & DeLuca four years ago.) This latest restaurant fills a brick-walled space. Up half a flight of stairs, there’s a Corian and stainless-steel kitchen and serving island. “It’s the stage in the middle,” Mr. Techakraisri said. Along one side of the island, the kitchen prepares sandwiches by day, and dinner entrees in the evening. All feature a choice of beef, turkey, salmon, pork or falafel. The food is high quality and well prepared, though the entrees could use better presentation than a cardboard tub. On the opposite side of the “stage” is a coffee bar and an area with pastries that becomes a wine and cheese bar in the evening. Tables line the perimeter of the space; there is no waiter service.

"A Caviar Shop With a Tasting Menu, on the Upper East Side",,"This Florida company has set up shop in New York.

Russian osetra from sturgeon broodstock raised in Israel is the top of the line. In addition to caviar, there are smoked fish, Ibérico ham, foie gras and other luxury items. Toward the rear of the shop is Huso, a 12-seat restaurant named for beluga (in Latin, huso huso), where the chef, Buddha Lo, an Australian who worked at Eleven Madison Park, prepares an all-day menu of small plates, like king crab with caviar in a lobster bun, Wagyu tartare with caviar, and caviar samplers with blini and buttery madeleines. In the evenings, starting next week, a multicourse tasting menu, $200, will be available. Marky’s is the work of Mark Zaslavsky and Mark Gelman, who started selling seafood, caviar and other imported specialties wholesale and retail, and opened a shop in Miami in 1983. By the late 1990s, they anticipated the restrictions on caviar from wild sturgeon that are now in place and set up an aquaculture operation dedicated to several species of sturgeon, including beluga, in northern Florida. This fall at their Sturgeon Aquafarms, they expect to be able to start producing beluga, for which they hold a government license and international certification. Their farming operation is also working with countries along the Caspian Sea to help restore the sturgeon population, especially for beluga.

On the ground floor, there are booths and tables, a semi-open kitchen and a bright prep counter. Upstairs is a marble oyster bar and more booths and tables. The menu is lengthy and divided into raw bar items, crudos, appetizers, seafood main dishes and vegetables, with a few pastas and meat dishes, like a burger and beef carpaccio. “I wanted to keep it simple and use as much local seafood as I could,” Mr. Vongerichten said. Locally harvested oysters, clams, fluke, mackerel, monkfish, sea scallops, lobsters and black sea bass share the menu with more far-flung catches, like Santa Barbara sea urchin, sardines, Dover sole, Icelandic cod and geoduck. Inventive sauces and garnishes, like rhubarb for sea scallops, are used throughout.

An Olive Oil From South Africa,Front Burner,"STELLENBOSCH, South Africa — For fine olive oil, South Africa does not readily come to mind. But the Mediterranean climate of the Cape wine region is excellent for olive trees, as Giulio Bertrand, an Italian who settled in Stellenbosch in the 1990s, discovered. Today it is estimated that the original plot — “the mother block” of trees on his estate, Morgenster — has provided millions of olive trees to growers in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, essentially kick-starting olive oil production throughout Southern Africa. Now, there are about 20 brands of extra-virgin olive oil in South Africa. Mr. Bertrand died last year at 91, but his daughters, Federica and Alessandra Bertrand, continue to run the estate, which has 30,000 trees and also produces wines. And the olive oils are perennial prizewinners. The 2018 bottling was ranked among the best in the world by Flos Olei, an olive oil guidebook. The 2018 oil is the estate’s flagship blend of 14 varietals, each picked and pressed separately before being combined.

Slather asparagus with miso for grilling. Make a “bouillabaisse” with fennel, potatoes, tomatoes and rouille but no fish. A “poke” bowl features beets instead of tuna. There are recipes for some Spanish classics, including gazpacho (with many variations). He gives advice on cocktails and vegetable scraps and occasionally slips in eggs, cheese and bacon.

Pastis Reopens After a Five-Year Hiatus,off the menu,"There’s no restaurateur better at channeling time-worn French bistros and brasseries than Keith McNally. Now, he has recreated one of his own restaurants, Pastis, moving it around the corner from the original and recycling tiles, mirrors and other vintage details that were kept in storage during its five-year hiatus. Even the phone number is the same. “In building Pastis, I’ve tried to capture the spirit of the original more than build a replica of it,” Mr. McNally wrote in an email. This time around, he has a partner, the restaurateur Stephen Starr, a good thing because as hands-on as Mr. McNally can be, he had a stroke two years ago. Mr. McNally said that, despite the “awful effects” of the stroke, he is very much involved. “He designed the restaurant and has been here constantly,” Mr. Starr said. The larger space, which cost $8 million to build, is configured differently from the original. The money is on the art, media and fashion world to return. “My ideal clientele would be layabouts, prostitutes and ex-cons, but we’ll probably attract models, writers and a few judges,” Mr. McNally said. The restaurant, which has already been besieged by reservation-seekers, will also attract people to the area, now home to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Line and top-shelf boutiques. About half of the menu is the same, serving escargots, onion soup gratinée, salade niçoise, steak-frites, mussels and, on Fridays, bouillabaisse. New dishes include herring with potatoes, duck with olives and boudin blanc sausages. This time, there is some seating at curved red leather banquettes á la Balthazar, another McNally hot spot.

Sound and Flavor Made in Harlem,Front Burner,"Take Marcus Samuelsson along with you into the kitchen or even on the subway. The chef and restaurateur, who is based in Harlem, has a new audio cookbook that incorporates the neighborhood and his flagship restaurant, Red Rooster Harlem, with stops in your home kitchen to whip up some peanut-bacon pork chops, fish in banana leaves and a Bloody Rooster cocktail. Mr. Samuelsson teams up with personalities like the writers Jelani Cobb and Dr. Jessica B. Harris to cook, with jazz and gospel in the background. The narrative covers the history of Harlem and changes in the area: “It gives people a new way to experience the community,” Mr. Samuelsson said. It comes with a digital copy of the recipes.

Just Add Peaches,Front Burner,"Stephen and Jessica Rose couldn’t find juicy, fragrant fresh peaches in Nashville, where they settled as newlyweds, so they did something about it. In 2012 the couple bought bushels of peaches — Mr. Rose is from Fort Valley, Ga., and was familiar with Pearson Farm there — loaded the fruit in a 1964 Jeep Gladiator and drove around Nashville selling them on weekends in summer. They are still at it with their peach truck, and visit more than 100 cities each summer. Now the couple has a cookbook that explains peach varieties, the history of the fruit in America and how to store, ripen and peel your peaches (though they don’t mention the serrated peeler I use for the job). Adding peaches to Dutch baby pancakes, to a cucumber gazpacho, to poundcake, to a Caprese salad and to condiments for pork and salmon are first-rate suggestions. I’m not sure I need peaches on pizza or with a steak, but when you’re in the peach business there are no limits.

He said his mandate for Robert Angell, the designer, was “no red lanterns, no stereotypes.” This branch contrasts with the one in London, on 33rd floor of the Shard building, which has an Imperial Palace profusion of gilt, black and red. Mr. Yeo’s Hutong restaurants specialize in Northern Chinese food, so expect impressive platters heaped with crisp soft-shell crabs, chile-fueled beef tenderloin ma la style, the inevitable Peking duck and, specifically for New York, deep-fried prawns with pickled vegetables, broad beans with Sichuan sauce, and squid “flowers” with chile dressing.

There’s also an octagonal little greenhouse, “The Conservatory for Confectionery Curiosities” (a collaboration with the artist Dana Sherwood), stacked with molded “desserts” made of resin with beautiful fake insects randomly stuck to them. They’re displayed on elaborate footed dishes. “The Conservatory” was previously on view in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris.",2019-07-16 09:00:07+00:00,"['Dion, Mark (1961- )', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Storm King Art Center', 'Hudson River Valley (NY)']"

An Unexpected Addition to the Cheese Board,Front Burner,"Anya’s Apothekere makes an unusual fermented honey sauce in three flavors: garlic, onion and jalapeño.

Anya Corson, the founder and chief executive of the St. Louis company, drew upon her culinary school training to create the probiotic preserve. The honey, added ingredients and splash of apple cider vinegar are all raw and organic, as is the wild yeast that works on the mixture over its three-month fermentation. It would make an unexpected addition to a charcuterie board, perhaps as an alternative to fig jam.

A Focaccia That Behaves Like a Pizza,Front Burner,"I have traveled to certain destinations just for one dish.

(In Recco, we ordered the dish, and when it arrived the two of us mistakenly thought we’d never finish it.) Now, Roberto Caporuscio, the owner of Kesté pizzerias in Manhattan, is baking the cheese focaccia at his spacious financial district restaurant. In addition to the mammoth classic, 25 inches across and available to order in advance, he’s baking an individual 8-inch size for $10 and a 12-inch for $15. “I’m from between Rome and Naples, so this was not something I knew about,” Mr. Caporuscio said. “But some customers asked about it, so I researched it, experimented and I’m now serving it.” His interpretation is worth the effort and the trip downtown if you don’t live nearby.",2019-07-22 19:41:14+00:00,"['Pizza', 'Focaccia', 'Cheese', 'Restaurants', 'Financial District (Manhattan, NY)', 'Keste (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)']"

Contemporary Fare at Red Paper Clip in the West Village,OFF THE MENU,"There’s no sign, but you might spot the red neon paper clip hanging high in the window of this very particular new restaurant. The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word “red,” often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. “It’s our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up,” Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. “The part of Tibet where I’m from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors,” Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. They’ll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from à la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. They’re just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas.

"Natural Wines, Explained",Front Burner,"In her slender new book, the wine writer Alice Feiring deconstructs natural wine, the trend that’s sweeping the wine world. Ms. Feiring, whose middle name should be “terroir,” starts by describing what natural wine is not: It lacks the fruit, power and oak of some high-end wines. Ms. Feiring takes the same approach to wine as she does to food, avoiding anything highly processed and additive-laden, and explains all the additives used in conventional wine production that natural winemakers don’t use. But she also gets into weedy details; amateurs might prefer to ignore sections on stuff like reverse-osmosis and infusion, and concentrate instead on how wine gets its color, the use or presence of sulfur in wine, how to find natural wines and why you should care. And if you’re planning a trip to France or a few other countries and want to visit natural wineries, she includes some guidance.",2019-07-29 23:18:08+00:00,"['Feiring, Alice', 'Wines', 'Books and Literature', 'Ten Speed Press', 'Natural Wine for the People: What It Is, Where to Find It, How to Love It (Book)']"

In second place was Professor’s Brie, made for Wegmans Food Markets from a mix of cow’s and sheep’s milk, also by Old Chatham and ripened in Wegmans caves. The third place winner was Shooting Star Creamery’s Aries, a semifirm, herbaceous sheep’s milk Alpine-style cheese made by Avery Jones, the 15-year-old daughter of Reggie Jones, an owner of Central Coast Creamery in Paso Robles, Calif. The top two winning cheeses, from a field of 1,742 entries, are notable for having been aged by retailers. The cheese from Wegmans, a small, mild, satiny square, is sold in the company’s stores ($9.99 for a 4.32-ounce square), and the pale, firm, herbal Shooting Star cheese is available on a limited basis only at Sigona’s Farmers Market in Palo Alto, Calif.

The name of this Upper West Side shop is a mash-up of “bar à choux,” French for cream puff bar. Her little pastries, made on the premises by a Parisian baker ($3.20 each), have finesse, delicacy and panache, thanks to their decorative topknots and the flavored fillings like lemon-meringue, dulce de leche, pistachio, chocolate and red velvet.

A Doughnut Six Years in the Making,Front Burner,"It was 25 years ago that Mark Isreal first began frying doughnuts on the Lower East Side at his Doughnut Plant.

They are not sour, though there’s a tantalizing hint in the one that’s seriously dark chocolate through and through.

You’ll find Spanish potato tortilla, slow-cooked salmon, crispy scallion-coconut rice, eggplant Bolognese, spatchcocked chicken, crostatas, brownies and chocolate chip cookies.

It’s an honest product not tricked up with caramel. Kitty Keller, an importer in Oakland, Calif., has some that are new to the American market, and they’re beauties. Copper-colored Mas d’en Gil, from Priorat, south of Barcelona, is more tart than sweet; use it to enliven a quick weeknight pan sauce for chicken or pork.

The result is mellower than most and can be sipped on its own, though a fortifying splash of gin or vodka would not be a mistake.

Pigs in a blanket, roasted bone marrow, clams in white wine, and a grain bowl are some of the appetizers. There are a few pastas, and main dishes include Berkshire pork tenderloin, king salmon with corn pudding, sea scallops with whipped celery root and asparagus, and a burger. Some meat and seafood selections can be ordered grilled simply. “Lots of our customers want no sauces and no vegetables, so we decided to serve some items like that,” Mr. Bellone said.

The Seattle-based chain takes pride in its restaurants, and, for this New York location, has brought over two notable Seattle chefs, Ethan Stowell and Tom Douglas. Mr. Stowell’s restaurant Wolf will be on the second floor with a mostly Italian menu that includes some Pacific Northwest items, like king crab and king salmon, along with polenta fritters, delicata squash with maitake mushrooms, spaghetti with uni butter and a burger. The room — with a 33-seat bar, an open kitchen and windows all around — is done in subdued gray tones with pale wood accents. On the second lower level, Mr. Douglas will be in charge of three places: Hani Pacific for pupu platters of dumplings, spring rolls and cured fish, more substantial curries and rice bowls; Jeannie’s for salads, pizzas, pastas and toasted sandwiches; and Oh Mochi for mochi doughnuts.

The fish are raised on feed made mostly from the trimmings of other fish. I roasted a one-and-a-half pounder, cleaned and scaled but whole, with a fillet of wild striped bass alongside to compare them.

"A Sleek, Tailored Tavern Comes to Hudson Yards",,"This addition to the Hudson Yards complex is about as sleek and tailored as a tavern can be. Designed by David Rockwell, it has polished wood, butterscotch leather and a soaring bar with multiple wine racks. It also provides a view of the Vessel, the complex’s centerpiece. The restaurant’s creators, Kenneth A. Himmel, a developer and restaurateur, with Marvin R. Shanken, the publisher of Wine Spectator and other magazines, describe it as an American brasserie. The chef, Eli Kaimeh, of Gramercy Tavern and Per Se, has responded in turn, creating a menu featuring a chopped salad, beef tartare, fancy pork and beans, steak-frites, herb-crusted sea bass, rotisserie chicken and a chocolate-orange creamsicle dessert. “We hope to appeal to the broadest spectrum possible,” Mr. Himmel said. “I believe that you shouldn’t be challenged by a menu.” Mr. Shanken has worked with the beverage director, the master sommelier Michaël Engelmann, to create the elaborate wine list. It includes a nice selection of wines by the glass and the half-bottle, as well as a large assortment of top-flight spirits. A second floor member-only dining club is to open in a few weeks.

But putting it in the No. 1 slot for the year isn’t a close call. Not that Mercado Little Spain is without flaws. It has its share, starting with a name that’s too long. But it has made the city’s Spanish food scene, what, five times better? Ten times? Mercado Little Spain gives us ingredients we’ve never tasted in New York before, like weeks-old Ibérico pigs slowly melted over fire, or imported rabbit — so flavorful that nobody will say it tastes like chicken — in the Valencian paella cooked over burning logs. It also sells high-fidelity transcriptions of dishes from the chefs Ferran Adrià, whose liquid olives are still blowing minds, and his brother, Albert, who fed recipes to the outstanding pastry department. Somehow, though, the most impressive foods are the most elementary: the gazpacho that shimmers with olive oil and sherry vinegar; the thick, dark hot chocolate that comes with churros just out of the fryer; the goblets of gin and tonics.

In addition to a classic lasagna Bolognese, a crespelle casserole of spinach-filled crepes, a dome of tomato-swathed Neapolitan timpano and an elaborate Sicilian timballo, Mr. Bugiani’s brief menu offers a few vegetable dishes, like eggplant Parmigiana and potatoes with truffles.

A Devotee of Basque Food Brings It to Two Bridges,,"At 21, Ryan Bartlow took off for Spain, most specifically for San Sebastián in the Basque region. The chef worked at some good restaurants in his hometown, Chicago, after culinary school, and then got himself a two-year stint at Akelarre, a restaurant with three Michelin stars overlooking San Sebastián, where he fell in love with the local food. Now 37, he is translating his passion for Basque food into a restaurant, named in homage to Hemingway, another Midwesterner devoted to Spain. After he left Spain, Mr. Bartlow returned to Chicago, worked at Alinea and then came to New York, where he held a number of jobs over the years, most recently at Frenchette and Quality Eats. He describes the food at Ernesto’s as a hybrid  influenced by Spain, Paris and Frenchette. Still, it’s richly infused with Basque flavors and ingredients, like morcilla en croute, fried hake with roasted peppers, salt cod in a Basque pepper sauce, and rice with rabbit and snails. “I’m not Basque, but I studied there and have roots there,” he said. “I feel as though San Sebastián is my home base.” Pintxos, Basque-style tapas bites, accompany drinks. The space, with windows on two sides, brick walls on the other, is dominated by a long bar. Adjacent to it on a side street, will be a cafe, opening in a week or so, for breakfast, pastries, sandwiches and, in the evening, pintxos from the open kitchen.

A Gluten-Free Greenmarket Baker Finds a Permanent Home,Front Burner,"When Deborah Brenner wanted to open a brick-and-mortar outlet for her pastry company, Las Delicias Patisserie, a Greenmarket regular for 10 years, she had to get permission from the people who run the Greenmarkets.

An economist and former banker, she got into this business because her husband is severely gluten-intolerant. As gluten-free goes, her treats are commendable, but she advises warming up the babkas and breads to improve them before digging in.

The effects of social and political change, years of war and the rise of the influential Spanish chefs of today are covered, as are ingredients like olives, anchovies and chocolate; markets; dishes like cocido; and time-honored utensils.

A Midwest Connection for Wagyu Beef,Front Burner,"In 2014, several Angus cattle ranchers in Ohio started raising Wagyu for Sakura Wagyu Farms, a company formed to set standards for the cattle.

Sakura’s own farms, also in Ohio, take care of the finishing, processing and distribution. Late last year, they could handle more orders, so the beef is now being sold in the Northeast. Though graded top quality according to Wagyu standards, well marbled and very tender, it is not as overwhelmingly buttery and fatty as some Wagyu. But it does deliver rich, beefy flavor. Strip loin, rib-eye and tenderloin steaks and roasts are available at Balducci’s markets in New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Virginia.

How to Serve Fonio,Front Burner,"Is fonio the new quinoa? This African grain, native to the regions just south of the Sahara, has been given that label. It has a lot going for it, as Pierre Thiam, a New York chef from Senegal, explains in his elegant cookbook. Fonio is easy and fast to grow. It’s also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africa’s agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesn’t clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa. I have served it topped with a ragout of mushrooms and used it in meatloaf.

"Peak, With 101st-Floor Views, Opens in Hudson Yards",off the menu,"At the pinnacle of 30 Hudson Yards, the tallest tower in the complex, will be this sleek restaurant with stunning views from the 101st floor. The architect David Rockwell’s company, the Rockwell Group, has given the space a richly elegant but subdued look with shades of gray as the dominant palette. The Peak experience involves entering through a dim, plush lounge for cocktails and bar snacks on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards’s retail building. From there, an elevator speeds up and docks at a spacious lobby, with the restaurant to one side and private dining rooms and an event space opposite. The restaurant dips gradually from a curved, brass-trimmed 45-seat bar area to a 110-seat dining room, where sculptural light sticks hang from the ceiling and bare tables on a few levels afford views like a bird’s-eye of the Empire State Building. Does it remind you of Windows on the World? Of course, but with less grandeur and gilt. The restaurant is run by RHC, the English company that also manages Wild Ink in Hudson Yards. The executive chef, Christopher Cryer, who was in that role at the Seamore’s seafood restaurants, has created a fairly brief menu of sophisticated yet accessible American fare like Atlantic scallops with cauliflower purée, beef tartare, rigatoni with lamb sausages, roasted monkfish with littleneck clams, cauliflower steak, braised short rib, rotisserie chicken and a fried potato terrine. Local ingredients dominate. (Opens March 12)",2020-03-03 16:41:33+00:00,"['Restaurants', 'Peak (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)', 'New York City']"

Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut.",2020-03-09 20:43:52+00:00,"['Veganism', 'Delicatessens']"

Buffalo Trace Releases Three Kosher Whiskeys,Front Burner,"Kosher wine is commonplace, and has been for some time. Kosher spirits, not so much. Many spirits are, in fact, technically kosher, but in most cases, they got there accidentally. The Buffalo Trace Distillery in Kentucky has taken a more proactive approach, working over the past 10 years with the Chicago Rabbinical Council on a line of purpose-built kosher American whiskeys.

Be a New Orleanian Wherever You Are,Front Burner,"You’ll need to assemble your own jazz band or find a playlist on Spotify to do justice to a Commander’s Palace dinner at home, especially for Mother’s Day. For the first time, the legendary New Orleans restaurant, in business since 1893, is serving a limited menu for delivery, shipped frozen and nationwide through Goldbelly. The menu offers a three-course dinner for two ($179) or four ($299), with turtle soup, garlic bread, sweet and spicy quail, and pecan pie. À la carte options, serving two or four, are also available. Though the soup just takes a reheat once it’s thawed, for the quail you’ll have to channel your inner Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse — the birds come raw with the ingredients and instructions for stuffing, glazing and roasting them.

A Quarantine Activity for the Wine Lover,Front Burner,"I’ve sabered open a bottle of Champagne. But disgorging one? Yes, try this at home. Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",2020-05-06 01:44:29+00:00,"['Wines', 'Brazil', 'Vinicola Geisse', 'Quarantine (Life and Culture)']"

He’s holding a platter above his head — shrimp Louie, a straw-covered bottle of Chianti, a bowl of grapes, a hunk of Swiss cheese — and he’s gazing down fiercely as if this were a romance novel and not a collection of recipes.",2020-05-29 14:30:00+00:00,['Cooking and Cookbooks']

The gin is notably silky, with a whiff of spice up front and subtle citric richness on the palate.

But, in today’s world, it means starting with takeout. Such is the case for Forsythia at 9 Stanton Street. “In the middle of construction everything went on pause,” said Jacob Siwak, formerly of Olmsted, who is the executive chef and owner. For the rustic Italian restaurant, where Mark Coleman, formerly of Rezdôra, is sous chef, and Brian Maxwell, of Gulfstream in Newport Beach, Calif., is baking, they are waiting until indoor dining restrictions are lifted before opening. In the meantime, it is offering takeout from a temporary East Village location, in a space that’s usually a cooking school. The menu is based on a working sojourn in Italy the men took before the coronavirus pandemic, and has Roman overtones. Focaccia with mortadella, short rib meatballs, supplì cheese and rice balls with asparagus and mushrooms, stuffed pastas like scarpinocc and tortellini, and a brioche bun filled with whipped cream are some of the dishes they’re planning and preparing for four-course takeout menus, $30 per person. The kitchen is open from 4:30 to 6 p.m. daily, except Sundays.

But there is some news worth noting: For the first time, beluga caviar, the roe of the largest variety of sturgeon, native to the Caspian Sea, has been successfully farm-raised in the United States. After 17 years of trying, Marky’s, a caviar producer, importer and dealer in Florida, has a crop of beluga from its Sturgeon Aquafarms in northern Florida. The importation, distribution and sale of purebred huso huso, or beluga, in the United States have been banned by the Fish & Wildlife Service since 2005, but this Marky’s caviar has been granted an exception to the ruling. So now, if you have $420 to splurge on a half-ounce, you can indulge in the delicate, buttery, nicely textured, though modest-grained, charcoal gray roe. And if a holiday in summer might not whet the appetite for jewel-box caviar, Marky’s also offers a celebratory package of American roes containing two ounces each of hackleback, paddlefish and salmon roes with blini and crème fraîche for $115 to enjoy on the Fourth.",2020-06-29 22:22:25+00:00,"['Caviar', 'Sturgeon (Fish)', 'Florida', ""Marky's Caviar""]"

Then they added a straightforward wheat vodka, and recently, a Danish-style aquavit that relies on farm-grown herbs. Refreshing cucumber vodka is new, and they’re also distilling potato-based whiskey-style aged spirits called Single Spuds.

Sunday Suppers and So Much More,Front Burner,"A big Italian family supper — a Sunday spread with pasta, red sauce “gravy” studded with meats, and more — defines the chef Joey Campanaro’s welcoming new book, “Big Love Cooking.” The meal comes in a late chapter, after you’ve explored biscuits dappled with sausage and cheese, spaghetti with clams (and anchovies), chicken cacciatore, halibut with pesto, and even sesame green beans, a keeper of a recipe that tracks more Asian than Italian, with the addition of oyster sauce and chile paste. Mr. Campanaro, a native of South Philadelphia and the chef and an owner of Little Owl in the West Village, seems to be right at your elbow, thanks to the easygoing, chatty text. If not Mr. Campanaro, maybe it’s his mother or grandmother reminding you to make “juicy bread … right?” to go with the Italian seafood stew. And if you have forgotten about veal Marsala, put it back on the radar and follow Mr. Campanaro’s finely tuned recipe.",2020-09-29 02:27:05+00:00,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Italian-Americans', 'Italian Food (Cuisine)', 'Campanaro, Joey', 'Big Love Cooking: 75 Recipes for Satisfying, Shareable Comfort Food (Book)']"

A Throwback Beer Returns to New York,Front Burner,"The Dodgers are long gone from Brooklyn. And so is Schaefer Beer, once a top-selling brand and a team sponsor that was brewed there.

Schaefer Brewing Company opened a new plant in Pennsylvania, and subsequently closed its other breweries, including the one in Brooklyn. All the while, Schaefer kept its slogan, “the one beer to have when you’re having more than one,” with a jingle that’s an ear worm for the ages. And now Pabst, the brand’s current owner, has brought it back to New York, though not Brooklyn, having it brewed by F.X. Matt in Utica. Schaefer is reformulated, with a classy new label but the same slogan.

He thought his family variation might have come about because his father was a dentist and advised against hard foods. Mr. Reiss would give it to friends and sell it in local shops. But recently, his daughter Kimberly Pertnoy thought the tender, pale yellow slices studded with chocolate chips deserved a wider audience.

The 14 Best Cookbooks of Fall 2020,,"In “Coconut & Sambal” (Bloomsbury, $35), Lara Lee, a chef living in London, explores her Indonesian roots, using her grandmother’s cooking as a jumping-off point. (Ms. Lee’s mother is Australian, and her father Chinese-Indonesian.) There are classic dishes: a chicken satay with a spicy peanut sauce, a beef rendang bubbling away in coconut milk bath that reduces so much it disappears, a bountiful gado-gado. But Ms. Lee keeps an eye toward innovation and substitutions. Desserts include a no-churn peanut and banana ice cream and kue pandan dan kelapa, a bright green pandan-and-coconut cake inspired by a treat her grandmother used to make. The latter can be made with raspberries, though it’s worth finding the pandan leaves for a dessert that, much like the book itself, is sweet but never cloying.

Some snacks, like shiso tempura with shrimp, and nori chips with salmon, are to be followed by warm and cold small plates, including scallops with avocado and yuzu, sushi rice with fish and cured egg yolk, and chicken dumplings in pork broth.

The Story of Barbuto,Front Burner,"Since 2004, Jonathan Waxman — the California chef credited for bringing the fresh, sunny cooking of his home state to New York decades ago — has been at the helm of Barbuto, a casual, welcoming and highly regarded West Village restaurant. It had to vacate its garagelike premises last year. Then, just a few weeks after opening in a new space nearby, Barbuto was derailed by the pandemic. Mr. Waxman’s new cookbook about the restaurant gives its history, notably explaining why so much of his food relates to Italy. Even his famous roast chicken is slathered with salsa verde. The recipes in this book, including the chicken, are simple affairs, often amounting to a centerpiece protein precisely cooked, then dressed with a salad or vegetable and sauce. His baked hake with leeks is a fine example. Cauliflower soup and cacio e pepe are two recipes worth whipping up on short notice.

She started researching and experimenting to develop a clear spirit, 80 proof, distilled from whey. She uses whey from family farms, and distills the spirit in Sebastopol, Calif., calling the process “farm to flask.” The result is smooth, with a silky texture and a hint of spice that’s elbowed out of the way by its sweet finish, making it alluring on the rocks and adaptable to many white-spirit cocktails.",2020-10-19 14:46:32+00:00,"['Alcoholic Beverages', 'Dairy Products', 'Wheyward Spirit LLC']"

To Have and to Hone,Front Burner,"Handle these Artisan Revere knives with care. These two models are so sharp, you’ll need to keep them in their leather sheaths. David Olkovetsky, a former steel company analyst, went into the kitchen knife business with a team of like-minded partners because he was not satisfied with what was available. His knives, which took more than two years to create, are made in Idaho using aerospace-rated technology and superdurable Elmax vanadium steel. It’s a costly material that has been tested by the Cutlery & Allied Trades Research Association, an independent lab in Sheffield, England, and shown to be highly durable, resistant to nicks and dents, and able to retain a razor-fine edge better than most other high-carbon stainless knives. The chef’s knife, with a dramatic 8 ½-inch blade, full tang and comfortable, easily grasped handle, is a welcoming tool that feels lighter than it looks. The efficient paring knife, triangular like a mini-chef’s knife, has a 3 ½-inch blade. The handles are available in several colors.",2020-11-02 22:24:54+00:00,"['Knives', 'Idaho']"

His “Experience” starts with a lush caviar canapé, followed by tangy vegetables à la grecque and a creamy lasagna freckled with black winter truffle. Tender braised short ribs of beef, in a silken wine sauce with baby vegetables, is the main course. A chocolate-paved marjolaine cake and a chocolate butter cookie with ganache complete the meal. Meticulous reheating and plating instructions are included for each dish.

These characteristics even held for the decaf version. Eric Ripert, the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin, said he had tasted Stone Street Coffee back in 2016 and was smitten.

He started a website, Better Rhodes, six months ago to meet what he sees as a growing market for nonalcoholic beers, wines and spirits, with more than 170 of them on the website. He said he has tried them all, but does not love them all. In his view, England has done the most with the category. “They’re way ahead of us, along with Australia, New Zealand and Canada,” he said. The widest selection is in gins, where the use of botanicals adds character, but he recommends them for mixed drinks, not in a martini. As for wines, he finds the best results in sparklers. A new one, Thomson & Scott’s Noughty from England ($19.99 for 750 milliliters), made from carbonated de-alcoholized chardonnay, nicely passes muster, especially when served with a nibble.",2020-12-29 01:01:52+00:00,['Beverages']

Remembering the Stately Dinners of a Private Club,Front Burner,"Since 1872, New York’s Lotos Club, a literature and arts organization founded in 1870 that occupies a townhouse on East 66th Street, has regularly held banquets to honor notables in the arts, government, science, entertainment, sports and the business world. Well-known people tried pulling strings to be the featured guest. The dinners also include elaborate menus, sometimes featuring the art of the honoree. It’s all documented in “Art at the Table,” a lavish new book that describes around 120 of the 439 dinners that have been held through 2019. In the first 50 or so years, oysters, green turtle soup, fillet of beef and an ice cream dessert dominated the menus. Back in 1874, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the celebrity guest, but no women were honored until 1922, when the opera singer Mary Garden was selected. (Women could not join the club until 1977.) The authors have threaded anecdotes throughout, like Mark Twain’s nap during his 12-course meal, a special Peruvian menu served for Mario Vargas Llosa and the menu printed on a Beethoven score for Richard Arnold, a violinist. The name of the club was taken from “The Lotos-Eaters” by Alfred Tennyson.",2021-01-05 03:31:14+00:00,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Lotos Club (Manhattan, NY)']"

"Nose-to-Tail Butcher Opens in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn",off the menu,"Personal need often drives the establishment of small, specialized food companies. Corey Hammond, who works in e-commerce and consulting, moved to Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, four years ago and missed having a convenient butcher. Then, as restaurants like Faun, Oxalis and Olmsted began opening in the neighborhood, he thought a local butcher might be welcome. He connected with Greg Brockman, who left Forager’s Market in Dumbo. In May, they opened a weekend pop-up butcher in the kitchen of Faun, and its success justified their idea. Now, they have opened their own butcher selling nose-to-tail meats from a number of local farms, 32 to 230 miles away as listed on their website. “We couldn’t have gotten started without the pandemic,” Mr. Hammond said. “The restaurant kitchen wouldn’t have been available for our pop-up.” The shop is worker-owned. “I wanted the people who helped to build this business to get something out of it,” Mr. Brockman said. “The food business is really difficult, and this way we can pay a decent wage and know the workers would be more dedicated.” There are three other people involved in the shop. In addition to a variety of cuts of meat and poultry, the shop will offer rotisserie chickens, charcuterie, condiments and seasonings, and sandwiches.

His partners are Rafiq Salim and Paul Wetzel, previously sous-chefs at Gramercy, and Ben Howell, who was a bar manager there and is overseeing front of the house. The pastry chef is Kelly Mencin, who is not a partner but was also at Gramercy Tavern. It took these colleagues more than five years to come back together for this project. The space is divided into a front room, meant to be the bar with banquettes and some high-top tables, and a partly skylit dining room that can seat about 100 people and has an open kitchen fitted with a wood-burning oven and grill.  For now, the bar is a counter where baked goods, homemade pastas, dips, sauces and ice cream are sold to take away, along with grocery items, wines, liquors and cocktails that use locally made spirits. The chefs have come up with a dinner package, $17 per person, for takeout and delivery that consists of a main dish like grilled porchetta with sides, including fried rice and cauliflower salad. Wood-fired half chickens, grilled greens, braised butter beans with salsa verde and focaccias with substantial toppings are among the other menu options. Housemade charcuterie is on the horizon. Stephen Maharam, a regular Gramercy Tavern customer, is another partner, running the business side, and Kermit Westergaard, the architect and contractor, is also a partner by virtue of owning the building.

A Chef’s Book Shows the Culinary Joys of Travel,Front Burner,"“The Relation Between Us,” the latest book from the Danish chef Bo Bech, is a page-turner. With 368 pages of his photographs, mostly of food scenes from around the world, interspersed with compelling text, the book is hard to put down (and hard to lift up). He says it covers 15 years of travel and eating. The tone of his writing (in translation) is chatty yet serious, threaded here and there with wonderment at some of his encounters, like the man in New Delhi who told Mr. Bech he was eating at the wrong places and offered restaurant recommendations one day at a time. Reading what Mr. Bech has to say might make you a more confident cook. He gives advice like this: “Remember, you can always add things. It’s harder to remove things.” He’s particularly attached to his chopping board and his blender and to Espelette pepper. Most of the nearly 40 recipes, in blocks of text, are simple and tempting, but often unusual — and one of the reasons I couldn’t stop reading — like one for corn in a pan, with butter and egg. There’s a dressing for shellfish made with onions and mezcal, a four-ingredient barbecue sauce, and risotto rice that’s baked and rested.",2021-01-19 17:15:02+00:00,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Bech, Bo (1972- )']"

Mashama Bailey’s the Grey Sets Up Shop at Intersect by Lexus,off the menu,"The somewhat-improbable combination of a high-end automaker and far-flung guest chefs and restaurants that opened on West 14th Street about two years ago has brought an interesting dimension to New York’s dining scene. The latest is Mashama Bailey, the chef who owns The Grey in Savannah, Ga., with her business partner, Johno Morisano. (The Grey opened in 2014, and is named for its location in a former Greyhound bus terminal.) Chefs from restaurants in Paris, Mumbai, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, have been in residence with Intersect’s chef, Nickolas Martinez, and Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, to run its kitchen. But the recent cancellation of indoor dining has finally turned the Intersect’s informal luxury toward takeout and delivery only. The Grey’s three-course menus with sides, $65 per person, plus tax, gratuity and delivery, are posted weekly on Mondays, and available Thursdays through Sundays. Its residency will continue through mid-April. At the Grey, Ms. Bailey, a Bronx native who moved with her family to Savannah in 1980, then back to New York before returning to Savannah, stitches together a personal take on Southern and soul food. This week’s nicely packaged menu features smoked catfish with rye crackers, yardbird chicken with captain sauce, and devil’s food cake. Leeks vinaigrette, red snapper and butterscotch cream will be served next week, and, the week after, there will be crab Louis, smoked lamb and a brown-butter fritter. Southern-style cocktails will also be sold. Intersect, which has a program of culinary training for formerly incarcerated youth, is donating 500 meals to health care workers.

The business of cooking dinner, for me, for a lot of us, is inextricably linked to the idea of service, to the notion that by feeding others we are offering pleasure as a kind of gift, a sacrament.

The Impermanence of Beauty,Front Burner,"Has vegan food ever been so beautiful? “Kajitsu,” a cookbook explaining the Zen Buddhist Shojin cuisine of Japan, offers page after page of magnificent seasonal dishes, with recipes. The book’s all based on the Murray Hill restaurant Kajitsu (now closed because of the pandemic), which moved to its present location from the East Village in 2013. And as the book explains, the restaurant, founded in 2009, will close permanently next year to respect the impermanence of things, according to Buddhist philosophy. So if you wish to remember the restaurant, or would be inspired to tackle its vegan recipes, including the most astonishing chirashi sushi you’re likely to encounter, this book is for you. But simpler recipes — like carrot potage, roast eggplant rice, and bamboo shoot and mountain vegetable sukiyaki, which require little background in Japanese ingredients beyond dashi, soy sauce and miso — are relatively few. Many require items like magnolia leaves, lily bulbs, kuromame (sweet black beans) and abura-age (a kind of fried tofu).

Both convey the tingling, almost numbing sensation on the tongue that is the hallmark of Sichuan pepper. Use the green on salads, vegetables and seafood; add the red to meatier dishes, tofu and rich soups, taking baby steps as you add the oil.

Onigiri for a Limited Time at Ootoya in Midtown,off the menu,"At the Times Square location of this international restaurant chain based in Japan, there’s a counter window that opens onto the street. From there, assorted selections of onigiri are being sold from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., daily through March 7. Previously, the window sold bento boxes, but the management decided to switch to onigiri. One reason was to offer freshly milled rice from the 2020 harvest in Niigata Prefecture, north of Tokyo. It’s being processed at the Rice Factory in Scarsdale, N.Y. The quality of the rice is as essential for onigiri as it is for sushi, but onigiri is more snack than art. Usually offered in tidy nori wraps for easy transport, the fillings are humbler than the masterfully sliced fish of sushi, and include canned tuna with mayonnaise, fried chicken and breaded pork tonkatsu, $3.75 to $5 each. There are also assortments, with side dishes like miso soup and potato croquettes, that can be delivered for an extra fee.

Penfolds Releases Wines Made From American Grapes,Front Burner,"Wines from outside Europe are often called New World wines. Penfolds, one of Australia’s premier wineries, is doubling down on being New World with its new California Collection, half of which consists of blends of cabernet sauvignon and shiraz (syrah) from California and Australia. Penfolds has been interested in California since the 1980s, and after considerable experimentation, it is now releasing four wines made mainly from grapes grown there, some from Australian cuttings it planted, blended with Penfolds fruit from Australia. The California varietals dominate. The powerful and complex top-of-the-line, Quantum Bin 98 cabernet sauvignon ($700 a bottle), which deserves cellaring, and the somewhat earthier and fruitier Bin 149 cabernet sauvignon ($149), both blends that include Australian wine, are labeled Wines of the World. There is also Bin 704 Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, which is all California ($70) absent sweetness or oaky swagger, but with a whiff of Napa Valley-style eucalyptus as it opens up.

Next Stop: The Story of a Restaurant,Front Burner,"The making of the Grey, a Savannah, Ga., restaurant in an Art Deco former Greyhound bus terminal, is a tale worth telling.

There were many potholes in their way, both personal and professional, having to do with construction, staffing, food supplies, customers and race. Among the challenges in adapting and restoring the 1938 bus terminal was whether to retain the sign that says “Colored Waiting Room.” (No spoiler from me.)

This Book Covers the Hard Stuff,Front Burner,"Dan Pucci and Craig Cavallo, the authors of the comprehensive new book  “American Cider,” say the drink that sustained colonial America is having a renaissance. They documented the resurgence of cider mills across the country, a 100-fold increase since 1991. Their thumbnail history of cider traces it from the Old World, around the time of Christ. This serious but easygoing book points out that ciders tend to be a local quaff unlike wine, which always had an international market. The authors discuss the many different apples (in the 19th century there were 1,000 varieties growing in the United States), which ones are suited for cider, how cider is made and even the geology of the land, as they survey ciders in eight regions across the country.",2021-03-01 22:46:22+00:00,"['Cider', 'Books and Literature']"
Venison All the Way From Hawaii,Front Burner,"Areas across the country, even some suburbs, have to deal with growing herds of often unwelcome deer. Count Maui, in Hawaii, among them. Axis deer, an Asian breed, were introduced for hunting in the mid-1900s, and they still attract the sharp-shooting crowd. But as their numbers have grown to the tens of thousands, the deer are also considered to be an invasive menace, not just on the roads, but for the way they denude the landscape of vegetation, causing erosion and water runoffs that can damage coral reefs. Maui Nui, a new company, is now turning them into dinner. Across the island, it harvests wild deer at night so the animals are supposedly less stressed and uses a mobile slaughtering facility. Now various cuts of venison, frozen, in preset combinations that include succulent racks, medallions, strip loins, stew meat for a nice braise and ground venison can be shipped to customers across the United States. The meat is mild-tasting, slightly beefy and tender. It’s also very lean, so add some slab bacon to your stew and plenty of olive oil to the ragù. A four-chop rack serving two will take about 20 minutes at 425 degrees for medium-rare. The company’s bone broth is delicious.",2021-03-01 22:50:19+00:00,"['Deer', 'Venison', 'Maui (Hawaii)']"

Now, with the restaurant project postponed, they have opened an inviting retail shop named Twiggy — after Mr. Mikolasko’s mother’s nickname — in the front of that space. The store has a bright display of quiches, thick rustic pizzas, bright green beans, roasted endives, crisp chiplike potatoes, several iterations of chicken (including fried), meat loaf and some salads, all offered on a rotating basis. There are also sensational pastries, including a deeply burnished tarte Tatin, ethereal lemon meringue cake and feathery raspberry mille-feuille.

New Meal Kit Options Beckon,Front Burner,"Food delivery platforms for restaurants cover a wide spectrum of cuisines and prices.

Ramp up the price point and you have another set of options from Taste, offering complete meal boxes from restaurants with Michelin stars on a weekly rotating basis. They require finishing at home with well-written instructions. The restaurants include Musket Room (fine duck rillettes, roast chicken, barley with mushrooms), Crown Shy, Benno, Mifune, Gabriel Kreuther, Casa Enrique and others, $29 to $108 per person.

She’s serving as creative adviser. Her friend Maneesh K. Goyal, an entrepreneur whose father owned a restaurant but who is new to the business, is doing the heavy lifting. He has brought on David Rabin, a partner in the Lambs Club, and the chef Hari Nayak, who has worked in kitchens in Bangalore, India; Bangkok; Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and elsewhere, after graduating from the Culinary Institute of America. Melissa Bowers designed Sona to evoke the Art Deco period that flourished in Mumbai in the 1930s.

Stately gilded columns brighten the front lounge and the rear main dining room in a space that’s elegant down to the tablecloths. Mr. Nayak’s menu, not the typical Indian culinary encyclopedia, covers the subcontinent and beyond with dishes like tandoor roasted beets, Malvani prawn curry, Malabar chicken biryani, and coal-roasted oysters spiked with chile, garlic and lime. There’s a black-spiced roast chicken feast for two, and a Goan fish curry in a tribute to the late Floyd Cardoz, who was a friend to both Mr. Nayak and Mr. Goyal.

It’s another of Ravi DeRossi’s many places (11 and counting) in the neighborhood, under his Overthrow Hospitality umbrella. Here, a compact dining room with a chef’s counter and seating outdoors are the backdrop for Ms. Freeman’s smoked grits with torched oyster mushrooms, a black-eyed pea and garlic pancake, maple buttermilk cornbread, stuffed collards with Aleppo rice, roasted purple yams with blackberry coulis and toasted marshmallows, and a seasonal fruit cobbler. Plant-based stand-ins are used in place of real dairy, as in the ice cream for the cobbler and the rosemary butter on the grits. Ms. Freeman is also serving her version of Southern-fried lasagna, a dish from her childhood. She worked in Washington, D.C., then at Mr. DeRossi’s Avant Garden, while completing her program at the Institute of Culinary Education. She has been vegan since 2017, and said her food expressed the “benefits of a plant-based approach while respecting beloved traditions.” The wine list, by Drew Brady, the wine director for the restaurant group, focuses on Black-owned wineries in South Africa, like Aslina, Bosman and Kumusha, and from California, including Longevity and Intercept.

The salmon are raised in big indoor saltwater pools fed from the area’s extensive aquifer. The fish, each about 12 pounds and raised without hormones or other additives, were harvested for the first time a few months ago, and were rated “best choice” by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch; they are now being sold as fillets, under the label Bluehouse Salmon.

A New Pasta Shape for Your Pantry,Front Burner,"Add cascatelli — inspired by the Italian word for waterfall, cascata — to your pasta vocabulary and your pantry.

The creation story has been documented on Mr. Pashman’s podcast as “Mission: Impastable.” He insisted on a shape that could be speared with a fork, and that would hold sauce well and have a proper bite. Traditionally extruded pasta shapes are made by forcing the dough through a die; a new, high-quality bronze die was made for cascatelli.

"Wylie Dufresne Starts Stretch Pizza, Selling Pies Out of Breads Bakery",off the menu,"Pizzerias, hold the brick-and-mortar, have become a thing during the pandemic and are probably here to stay. A growing list of restaurants have opened takeout pizza divisions to expand without establishing separate storefronts and kitchens. Now, Breads Bakery, a retailer and cafe near Union Square, has done the same. And it’s with a marquee chef, Wylie Dufresne, who is adding pizza to a career that includes avant-garde molecular food and doughnuts. Mr. Dufresne was a fan of the bakery, got to know Gadi Peleg, the owner, and they decided to collaborate on New York-style pizza. There are four options for the 12-inch pies ($19 each), which must be ordered online, in advance, for pickup. The pizzas will be available starting April 20. The choices are Classic New York, with tomato sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan; Couch Potato, with fingerlings, sour cream, rosemary, scallions, mozzarella and Parmesan; Sketches of Spain, with romesco sauce, grilled ramps, mozzarella and Parmesan; and the Everything, topped with cream cheese, aged mozzarella, everything spice and chives (adding smoked salmon before serving would not be a mistake). There’s also a breakfast calzone filled with scrambled eggs, Muenster and American cheeses, and scallions ($7.50). The mozzarella Mr. Dufresne is using is aged, and the sauces are all homemade.

Veranda’s main dining room is up from the street, and designed in greenhouse fashion with a retractable ceiling. It’s surrounded by outdoor seating on an upper terrace and a multilevel garden.

It operates like many others: Unscrew the top, fill the cylinder, replace the top and grind by turning it. An important feature is the ease with which the texture can be adjusted, by turning the lower band with nine gradual markings.

Wild Alaskan King Salmon Season Has Begun,Front Burner,"The wild Alaskan king salmon season started last month, but the catch from the prized Copper River fishery will not be available for another two weeks. Anticipating high demand, a number of companies are already accepting preorders for the richly flavored fish that has packed on fat and muscle so it can strive against the current, up the river to spawning grounds. A relative newcomer to the game is Kyle Lee, an Alaskan whose company, Alaskan Salmon in Cordova, operates on a smaller scale than some others; it is run by fishermen. The fish are frozen upon harvesting and shipped that way directly to consumers, the typical practice. Alaskan Salmon will charge $75 a pound (about three portions) in five-pound boxes for $375.

Olive Oil Conquers the Plant-Based Dessert,Front Burner,"Plant-based versions of ice cream (which cannot use the term cream) are proliferating faster than new flavors from Ben & Jerry’s. Every possible alternative “milk” — pressed from beans, grains, nuts and so forth — now beckon as vanilla and chocolate in the frozen food aisle. A newcomer, Wildgood, has taken a somewhat different approach, with a vegan frozen dessert that relies on olive oil. It’s the result of eight years of trial and error by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who studied gelato in Italy and created an ice cream brand in Greece. Among the ingredients that help turn extra-virgin olive oil into a frozen confection are chicory root, pea protein and carob-bean gum. It’s around 10 percent fat, and there are eight flavors: chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, mango, mint-chocolate chip, sea salt caramel and the best of the lot, pistachio and chocolate-hazelnut. Perhaps using nuts helps with the texture because despite the olive oil, the end result has more of an ice milk lightness instead of the dense richness of a super-premium product. Mr. Tsichlopoulos’s company has support from Gary Hirshberg, a founder of Stonyfield Farm, among others.",2021-05-03 20:45:49+00:00,"['Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts', 'Olive Oil']"

It’s a lovely summer quaff. “The climate and soils of northern Sonoma County are ideal for producing world-class Bordeaux varietals, particularly sauvignon blanc,” said Craig McAllister, the head winemaker. Bordeaux is the operative term here. The wine, in a clear Bordeaux-style bottle, displays more subtle fruit, notably citrus and pineapple, integrated with good acidity, than the grassy herbaceousness typical of sauvignon blancs from other regions.

It is acid-resistant and an extremely good conductor; as you sauté you will see the steam from evaporation rising quickly, with the result that liquid reduces easily to thicken your sauce. It pays to lower the cooking temperature a bit when sautéing so ingredients do not burn. The drawback is that the lovely heat-resistant wooden handle cannot go into the oven.

Merely leafing its pages results in tidbits of information like this: When spinach is very fresh and you rub the leaves together, “they should squeak.” The massive illustrated volume (640 pages) covers hundreds of vegetables, grouped in categories, with history and advice on growing, buying, storing and using. There are scores of recipes from Jamie Simpson, the institute’s head chef; if you make only one of them it should be the luscious carrot pot roast.

Carrots Give This Beef Flavor,Front Burner,"Santa Carota beef is raised on a ranch near Bakersfield, Calif.

The ranch started adding carrots from local farms to the finishing feed in 1989; now it’s all carrots because it liked the results. Chefs, including Wolfgang Puck and Gordon Ramsay, did too, and became regular customers. The beef — available in New York strip, rib-eye, filet mignon, tomahawk and hibachi strips, with other cuts coming soon — is now being sold retail for the first time through Holy Grail Steak Company. Each cut is shipped frozen and is available in a regular grade or prestige, the equivalent of prime.

A Wine With Whispers of History,Front Burner,"Back in 1969, when his Heitz Cellar was in business for a mere eight years, Joe Heitz made a wine he called Lot C-91. It was an assemblage of cabernet sauvignon fruit from several of the property’s Napa Valley single vineyards. Mr. Heitz died in 2000, never having made the wine again. But Brittany Sherwood, now the winemaker, used Mr. Heitz’s notes and a few existing bottles of the original wine for guidance on replicating the wine. The new Lot C-91 from the 2016 vintage is a sleek blend of cabernet sauvignons from the Rutherford, Oakville, Howell Mountain and St. Helena districts. It’s a youngster that’s pleasing to drink now for its bright, well-integrated fruit, minerality and hint of spice. But it certainly deserves to be cellared for years to reach its full potential. The wine is being released to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Heitz Cellar, which is now owned by Gaylon Lawrence Jr. and his family; Carlton McCoy Jr is a managing partner.",2021-05-17 19:57:21+00:00,"['Wines', 'Heitz Cellar (St Helena, Calif, Winery)']"

He details the history of barbecue back to its Indigenous roots in pre-Columbian days, and recounts how it became part of the culture of enslaved Africans. It was entrenched in Black community life, but was taken over by white cooks starting in the late 19th century, he writes. Part of this change was because of urbanization. Instead of pit-roasted whole hogs, smaller cuts of meat like ribs and brisket were used because they were easier to handle in restaurants, and chefs got involved. Now the recognition is improving, he says, but there is work to be done.

Mr. Fraser will also curate the prepared grab-and-go items, including some by Mr. Muñoz, at Louis, a ground-floor market and coffee bar.

There are three wood ovens. On the Cantina & Pisco Bar menu will be razor clams, and hearts of palm with avocado. Louis will offer a ceviche bowl, Peruvian-style sandwiches and also a loaded Chrystie Street kosher hot dog; Mr. Muñoz will be coming up with cocktails at Cantina and Popular, many based on pisco, the grape spirit of Peru.

A New Source for Seafood,Front Burner,"Buying seafood online has never been easier, thanks to the demands of all the stay-at-home cooks during the pandemic. There is a proliferation of new sources, and one of them, E-Fish, is the outgrowth of a wholesale company that started selling fresh fish from various sources to restaurants last year. “Chefs had to deal with individual fishermen and it was complicated for them, but by aggregating we made it easier,” said Jeff Tedmori, the chief executive and a graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of Management. He came up with the idea with his business partner and the chief operating officer Matthew Henderson, whose family has been in the fish business for generations. Soon after they saw that the fishermen on their roster could not do enough business with so many restaurants closed, they opened for consumer sales. They say most of their products are harvested to order and shipped within a day. What is especially appealing for those of us in the East is that they carry some West Coast varieties that we rarely see, like succulent petrale sole, California king salmon and live spot prawns.

Since its founding in 2016, the organization has moved beyond just restaurants to showcase all kinds of businesses, from food trucks to caterers to bakeries.

It leans on botanicals like Brazil nut, Victoria regia (a type of water lily) and cocoa. The distillery is on an 18th century coffee farm in the Paraíba Valley northwest of Rio de Janeiro.

"Angie Mar’s Latest, Les Trois Chevaux, Opens",off the menu,"Angie Mar is entering a new stage of her career with the opening of this elegant tribute to fine dining. “This is my restaurant, not something I inherited, and I was looking for fresh ideas,” she said. Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms — bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu — this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isn’t offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. “It’s a vast departure, but what I want right now,” she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like André Soltner and Jacques Pépin; a painting by Mr. Pépin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her father’s favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staff’s Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurant’s name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers.

Last month, the Food staff made the most of summer’s bounty while keeping the recipes short, sweet and, most importantly, low on heat (with a few exceptions).

A Long Island Farm Adds Classes,Front Burner,"Nick Voulgaris III, who grew up in Huntington, N.Y., remembers going as a child to Kerber’s Farm, a local farm and store that was founded in 1941. About 10 years ago, the owners planned to sell it to a developer. Mr. Voulgaris, who had become a restaurateur and caterer, bought it, renovated it and reopened it. “I had a nostalgic connection,” he said. On a mere two acres he raises organic vegetables, flowers, chickens, ducks, pigs, goats. There’s also a farm store, with a bakery and a cafe known for chicken potpie. “It’s our own mini-ecosystem,” he said. He has just added a farm school, with classes for children and adults in growing and harvesting vegetables, beekeeping, raising livestock, sustainability, and, in one of the barns on the property, cooking.

Seasonal Desserts That Surprise,Front Burner,"The chapters in “Wild Sweetness,” a dessert cookbook by Thalia Ho, an award-winning food blogger who lives in Australia, unfold according to seasons, but without your typical peach pie in summer or pumpkin for fall. It’s a subtler, more elegant and personal collection, threaded throughout with chocolate. Several fancy confections are included, but most of the cakes tend to be tidy loaves or single layers, perhaps with some crumble or glaze on top and begging for a glass of sweet wine. There are several brownies and blondies, some uncommonly scented with figs and bay leaves; a brownie made with cocoa is a simple delight. Most cookies are easy, made by scooping batter onto baking sheets, and include chocolate chunk with some buckwheat flour for an earthy counterpoint. The author’s photographs are lovely. The recipes I tried all needed a bit more baking time than called for (my ovens are precise, recently calibrated), so the cook should pay more attention to Ms. Ho’s guidelines for testing doneness than to the clock.",2021-07-12 14:13:42+00:00,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Ho, Thalia', 'Wild Sweetness: Recipes Inspired by Nature (Book)', 'Desserts']"

His Cronut aptly demonstrates his talent and imagination. Now, with his new NoMad workshop, he is delving deeper into the possibilities offered by the genre. “For 12 years working in Paris, it was all I was doing, and I saw how creative you could be,” he said. His idea is to produce classics like a crisp-skinned croissant with a properly honeycombed interior, but also to disrupt the category. So there is a delicious, flaky multigrain croissant, and one made with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. He’s making a type of brioche scented with orange and star anise, another pastry filled with rice pudding and huckleberry jam, and crunchy gougères oozing Comté cheese. The space is just a kitchen with a sales counter, so plan to eat your purchases at the few tables outside or soon after you get them home; Mr. Ansel says their shelf-life is brief.

What to Cook This Weekend,,"Good morning. “I don’t question that the greatest meal salad of all time, the chef salad, was created by a chef,” Gabrielle Hamilton wrote for The New York Times Magazine this week. “The combination of textures and flavors is consummately professional. Sometimes people mistake the salad bowl for a lawless place of disorganized and mismatched ingredients, chopped up and thrown in — dried cranberries on top of pumpkin seeds on top of soggy corn — which offends even me, who stakes no strong claim to her chef bona fides. A salad nonetheless requires a bit of cheffing, a little experienced attention paid to balance, texture and restraint.

The partners were inspired by Parisian neo-bistros and wine bars. “Their quality is at a high level, but they’re more informal than restaurants,” Mr. Neidich said. The menu features small plates, many of them with seafood like lobster salad, oysters and salmon rillettes. A few more substantial items include halibut and chips, and paella rice with duck and snails. Among the desserts is chocolate babka with salted caramel ice cream.

Though his company imports 22 different oils, some are worth knowing, like leccino oils by Pruneti, a classic; and Sàgona, more forceful, $59.99 for both. A new oil for his company is the herbaceous Fonte di Foiano 1979 from the Bolgheri region, sold as part of a set of six from areas in and around Chianti for $157.50. Also in that set is the Volpaia from the Classico district, a blend of several olives that’s deep green, minty and viscous with bracing bitterness.

Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. It’s salty enough to use in place of table salt, though it’s substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sautéed fish. That flavor disappears in cake batter or pasta sauce.

He describes his career, from low-rung beginnings as a food runner to a sought-after mixologist in Japan and New York. The book explains high-end cocktail bars in Japan and more informal izakayas; his bar blends both. Many of the book’s recipes, with long drinks and Japanese riffs on classics, are demanding; some simpler examples are the Japanese highball using frozen whiskey; the Far East Side with sake, tequila and shiso leaves; and Friday in the Park combining pear cider and vermouth (though he recommends making your own vermouth).

Topping the special occasion list is Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins this year — 5782 — at sundown on Sept. 6. Apples are a symbol of the holiday on the Ashkenazi table, and the book features recipes for a cake studded and topped with them and bits of ginger. A very basic challah recipe and the whole-wheat version are included without directions for shaping the bread round, instead of braided, as is customarily done for the holiday. Rather, challah rolls with apple filling make suitable stand-ins, and the dough can be used to make one large loaf. The recipe for pletzel, a Polish specialty that’s also called onion board, deserves to be added to your flatbread collection. The book taps traditions, including those of Sephardic and Mizrachi cultures, in addition to Ashkenazic.

Bar Benno Opens in the Former Leonelli Restaurant and Bar Space,off the menu,"Now that it’s time to begin reopening his restaurants in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad, the chef Jonathan Benno and his partners decided to do more than simply turn the key. In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, they’ve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when it’s ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors d’oeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pâté de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provençal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pig’s trotter with sauce gribiche. “I didn’t feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before,” Mr. Benno said. “I’ve been cooking French most of my whole career, so I’m very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation.” Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space that’s something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building.

But a beveragino can also be a coffee, a tea, a limeade or a mocktail. Much like life, a beveragino is what you make of it. Ultimately, what may distinguish a beveragino from a beverage is a certain kind of effortless upgrade: not just a cold brew, but a cold brew with a sweet-salty cream cap; not just any old tequila cocktail, but one that’s part Negroni, part spritz.

Fall Restaurant Preview: A Reboot for New York,,"New York City’s fall restaurant season will effectively be the first in two years, and though Covid is a wild card, chefs and restaurateurs are forging ahead with openings and reopenings, often resuming projects that have been on hold. Ambitious restaurants in the heart of Manhattan from Union Square to 59th Street, like Le Pavillon and Iris, have been up and running, with new places set to join them. Prominent players like Danny Meyer, Laurent Tourondel, Ignacio Mattos and Franklin Becker are expanding their portfolios. Rick Bayless of Chicago, and Will Beckett and Huw Gott of London’s Hawksmoor are all making New York debuts. New steakhouses are still arriving, and Indian food, both fast-casual and formal, continues to get fresh attention. Despite the loss of some marquee names, there are signs of life in Hudson Yards. High-end sushi bars keep opening. And so far, despite the challenges of staffing and getting supplies delivered, the openings appear to be happening on time — a departure from past years, when many were delayed for months.

‘The Big Book of Amaro’ Chronicles the World of the Bitter Spirit,Front Burner,"In an encyclopedic new book, the Italian amari expert Matteo Zed covers the spirit, the bitter drink as old as monasteries and made new in Brooklyn.

He tells their history, describes the 50 botanicals often used when making them, gives an idea of their styles and sorts them into categories. There’s an amaro renaissance going on worldwide and he helps it along, with his favorite ways to enjoy the spirit. There are descriptions of more than 200 Italian brands, a fascinating region-by-region and bottle-by-bottle survey, followed by a handful of amari from other countries.

A New Food Hall for Midtown,Front Burner,"Hugh Stubbins, the architect of a landmark skyscraper with an angled roof at Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, now has his name emblazoned over the entrance to a spacious and soaring new food hall called the Hugh, which occupies the heart of the building’s ground floor.

Her grilled mahi mahi with black olive vinaigrette is not the only fish recipe that calls for a mayonnaise or aioli coating to prevent sticking.

The No. 3, for example, is made with Jin Jili India Darjeeling Dry Gin, grapefruit, elderflower, mint and star anise; the grapefruit makes it delicious. The fragrant No. 1 combines Hendricks gin with makrut lime leaves, coriander seeds and lime juice, though come fall, it will be varied with apple flavors. For the No. 4, which has cucumber, cumin, fennel and Plymouth Gin, the cucumber will soon be replaced with pear. The popular No. 2 will lose its muddled strawberries for persimmon, but the black peppercorns will still be in the generous balloon glass.

Originally the set came in a small and a medium size, for burners up to 3 3/4 inches in diameter. He has just introduced a large size for burners 4 to 5 1/2 inches. All the rings come with sets of legs; depending on the configuration of your burners and grates, setting them up securely can be tricky.

Yes, and yes. The thick batter is not so easy to assemble but the effort is worth the results: more than a dozen giant cookies (more than four inches in diameter). I made smaller ones with half the batter and they turned out fine. This is not a book to consult for dinner; most of the recipes, like the cafe itself, which now has several locations in New York and Canada, suit lunch, all-day dining and light suppers. Salads and sandwiches abound. I also recommend the red wine, mushroom and onion soup; the cherry tomato, caramelized onion and feta tart; the olive oil-blood orange loaf; and the spiced turmeric tea.",2021-09-20 19:32:54+00:00,"['Maman (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Maman: The Cookbook (Book)', 'Marshall, Elisa', 'Sormonte, Benjamin', 'Salkeld, Lauren']"

Join the Cider Club,Front Burner,"As cider makers continue to hone their craft, food-friendly options have increased exponentially. Poured into stemware, the golden drinks shine at dinner; they are less filling than beer and lower in alcohol than wine. One way to explore a variety of ciders is with the new Cider Society subscription packages, offered quarterly, from Virtue Cider in Fennville, Mich.  The first one, for the fall season, has four bottles of the company’s new single-varietal ciders, a change of pace since most ciders are blends. Golden Russet, Spitz, Baldwin and Jonathan, all lightly sparkling and deliciously dry, have distinctive profiles. There’s a whisper of mellow sweetness in the Golden Russet and the Spitz, and the Baldwin suggests sauvignon blanc.

A New Destination for Tea Lovers in Brooklyn,Front Burner,"Last year Zach and Minami Mangan, importers of tea from Japan, dipped their toes into the retail market with a Kettl stand in the tiny mall on the Bowery in NoHo.

There’s a communal table in the middle and, in the rear, a concrete tasting counter; in the front is a takeaway window, which is comparable to the Bowery spot. The Mangans have brought in a matcha grinder from Japan; Mr. Mangan also does some of his own roasting. And at this location they’ve added a menu of tea-driven sweets, including a chestnut Mont Blanc cake with matcha, delicate mousses, a baroque layered parfait, and excellent matcha chocolate chip cookies that play up the chocolaty taste of the tea. The confections are made by Chika Hanyu, a pastry chef nearby. “Our expertise is tea so we didn’t want to get involved in running a kitchen,” Mr. Mangan said.",2021-09-27 20:42:56+00:00,"['Tea', 'Greenpoint (Brooklyn, NY)', 'Kettl Tea Inc']"

The collaboration between Jake Dell, the owner of Katz’s, and Lesley Gracie, the master distiller at Hendrick’s, came about as an April Fools’ gag. This year, Hendrick’s posted a recipe for gin-infused pickles on Instagram without any intention of selling them. But the response was such that they ended up working with Katz’s.

Cheese Making at Jasper Hill Farm Gets a French Advantage,Front Burner,"Mateo Kehler, the cheese maker who owns Jasper Hill Farm in northern Vermont with his brother, Andy, has just eliminated a lot of backbreaking work for the esteemed creamery.

The secondhand vats, which can handle 3,000 liters (3,170 quarts) of milk, replace Mr. Kehler’s smaller vessels. Most importantly they are engineered so the curds are transferred to a vacuum system by gravity to the lower level of the creamery where they are pressed and formed, and no longer require the hands-on chore of moving the curds manually. “It’s automated, easier to clean, there’s no waste, we can make more cheese and they will be more consistent,” he said.

The technique is bare bones, leaving no option for adjusting the texture to taste: lightly sauté the rice in extra-virgin olive oil (included), then add a measured amount of boiling salted water all at once and cook, stirring.

Mr. Wangeman came from Oaxaca right after high school and studied at the Culinary Institute of America to become a pastry chef, and worked at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain and Per Se in New York. He returned home to deepen his understanding of Mexican cuisine, and later, back in New York, opened pop-ups featuring traditional Mexican ingredients. His wife, a physician whose mother, Carina Santiago Bautista, is the owner and chef of Tierra Antigua near Oaxaca, joined him in the business. Mr. Wangeman said they feature tacos al pastor and that their gringas are made with corn tortillas instead of the more typical wheat but that they use cacahuazintle, an heirloom varietal that is soft and white like wheat flour.

This mixture of styles is beautifully presented in “Liguria,” an informative new cookbook by Laurel Evans, a Texan who married a Ligurian and sought the culinary secrets of his extended family and friends.

Peking Duck With Added Fire,Front Burner,"At its locations in Hong Kong Dubai, Hutong has been serving flaming Peking duck. Now the newly reopened dining room of the lavish restaurant chain’s New York branch also offers the glistening duck licked with blue fire tableside. More than mere floor show, the duck is seasoned with a chile-forward marinade. The flaming is said to impart extra crispness to the skin. Regardless, it is delicious, a whole well-burnished duck expertly carved, presented with accouterments, including sauces other than hoisin, and enough to serve four, $116. A second course is made with the meat left after slicing, minced with vegetables in a lettuce wrap, for a dish that’s more Cantonese than Beijing. As of now only five flaming ducks are available a night Monday through Thursday evenings to book in advance.

Now, he has another restaurant ready to make its debut next door. Called Four, it’s in a historic Victorian cottage. (The two restaurants connect by a glass-covered pavilion that functions as an expanded dining room for 2 Spring.) Four has just 10 upholstered seats at a marble counter surrounding a demonstration kitchen done in simple Scandinavian style with blond wood set within the cottage’s white brick and siding. A painting of Anthony Bourdain is a centerpiece on one wall, and a huge Bonnet range equipped with a Japanese charcoal grill helms the kitchen. There, Mr. Schenker will be onstage so to speak, preparing and serving a 10- to 12-course tasting menu, $245, for one of the more elevated dining experiences available on Long Island. Mr. Schenker said he missed the ad hoc menus he used to prepare on Mondays at Recette. “I am thrilled for the opportunity to cook in a similar intimate style for my guests,” he said. Among the dishes he’s planning are an oyster tartlet, langoustine with Champagne essence, rigatoni with giant clam and chiles, foie gras with a duck fat croissant, Mishima Wagyu with wasabi and onion, and chocolate pot de crème. Mr. Schenker’s attention to detail will extend beyond the food and the list for 500 wines (from an underground cellar) to the tableware, with no pieces repeated throughout the dinner.

But even at their most complex, the recipes hold promise for the home cook. A button mushroom soup stands deliciously on its own without the chorizo-potato raviolis alongside, and can easily be made to serve four or six instead of 12.

Top 10 New York Dishes of 2021,,"Restaurants began the year in darkness. Dining rooms in New York had been closed, again, by order of the governor. Is it any wonder that some of my strongest memories of the year in eating are takeout and delivery dishes? Or that, once restaurants were allowed to serve indoors again in February, the things that tasted best tended to be enduring classics like chicken soup from Eastern Europe and egg rolls from the streets of Saigon? Here are the 10 dishes — in no particular order — that dance in my vision when I close my eyes, all of them taken from establishments in the city that for one reason or another did not make my list of the year’s best new restaurants.",2021-12-14 16:33:58+00:00,"['Restaurants', 'Two Thousand Twenty', 'Dame (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)', 'Falansai (Brooklyn, NY, Restaurant)', 'Mariscos El Submarino (Queens, NY, Restaurant)', ""Mark's Off Madison (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)"", 'Nneji (Queens, NY, Restaurant)', 'Seabird Bakery (Brooklyn, NY)', 'Under the Volcano (Manhattan, NY, Bar)', 'Pecking House (Queens, NY, Restaurant)', 'Sunken Harbor Club (Brooklyn, NY, Bar)', 'Burchak Pide (Brooklyn, NY, Restaurant)', 'Brooklyn (NYC)', 'Manhattan (NYC)', 'Queens (NYC)']"

"Casa Dani, From a Celebrated Spanish Chef, Opens in Manhattan West",off the menu,"New York first met the Spanish chef Dani Garcia at Manzanilla on Park Avenue South. That was eight years ago. Since then, Dani Garcia, his restaurant in Marbella, Spain, picked up a third Michelin star (it’s now closed), and the chef formed his own company, Grupo Dani Garcia. Now, he has returned to New York and is on the marquee of Casa Dani in the Manhattan West complex, west of the Moynihan Train Hall. “What I’m doing at Casa Dani is not fine dining,” he said. “I want to showcase the culture of Spain, making it easy, fresh and fun, more like home cooking.” He said a great deal had changed since he was first in New York, especially the increasing availability of ingredients. His thinking has also changed, he said. “Twenty-five years of fine dining, which is more conceptual and less from the heart, is enough,” he said. What hasn’t changed is having Alberto Carballo, the chef de cuisine, at his side. A soaring 180-seat dining room, a sea of beige designed by David Rockwell, sits on a level below the bar and open kitchen. There are tapas; fried items like cod fritters; bigger portions (raciones), many with seafood; and rice and noodle specialties. There are also a few main dishes, including daurade and hanger steak, and even larger-format platters for the table like whole Spanish turbot. A section on the menu is devoted to fresh tuna prepared several ways, which Mr. Garcia considers to be representative of the soul of Spanish cooking. Near the entrance to Mr. Garcia’s restaurant, which he runs with Sam Nazarian, is his Pollo Verde, a casual spot in the Citizens NY food hall at the complex.",2021-12-14 18:02:25+00:00,"['Restaurants', 'Rose, Daniel (1977- )', 'Baxtrom, Greg', 'Casa Dani (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)', 'Manhattan (NYC)', 'Hoboken (NJ)', 'East Hampton (NY)', 'Southampton (NY)', 'Brooklyn (NYC)']"

What to Cook This Week,,"Good morning. I spent an hour on my back on the sidewalk in the cold recently, swapping out a single bulb for the headlight of my car.

There’s not much room for one hand in there, much less two, much less getting eyes or light on the situation. It’s a little like solving a Rubik’s cube while blindfolded, while a cat mauls your forearms. That Matthew B. Crawford is correct. Manual competence is terrific.

The whole fish, about a pound and a half, comes to market impeccably fresh. The flavor is quite delicate and the texture lacks the meaty succulence of wild striped bass, even when roasted to perfection in a wood oven, as mine was at Nick & Toni’s in East Hampton, N.Y.

Jody Williams and Rita Sodi Open Commerce Inn in the West Village,off the menu,"In their latest venture, Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who own four highly regarded restaurants in the West Village, have been seduced by history. And it’s not just the history of this location, which was built in 1911, and formerly housed Fifty, Commerce, Grange Hall, Blue Mill Tavern and a speakeasy before that. “We’re taking it back to a colonial tavern,” Ms. Williams said, even including a Tavern Room, fitted with a dark wood back bar, a zinc counter, custom stools and compact booths. They also did their homework, looking to an old store in Virginia that was once a train station for floor and ceiling boards, a Vermont maker of Shaker-style furniture for the chairs and benches in the large dining room and even the fonts Ms. Sodi used for the menu. “It’s all about simplicity and craftsmanship,” Ms. Williams said. Food in the tavern, open now with the dining room coming soon, starts with oysters served raw, pickled or fried. Then the choices are smoked cod cakes, country ham, marrow with mushrooms, greens with buttermilk dressing, spoon bread and baked apple. Wines are domestic, mostly East Coast. The dinner menu, in the sparsely decorated white-tablecloth dining room, will feature roasts like duck and pork. For breakfast, also on the horizon, there will be scrapple, porridge, eggs and smoked fish. In keeping with the historic approach, bartenders haul ice for drinks like milk punches and switchels in 25-pound blocks with vintage tongs, and electronics are hidden in drawers. There is no espresso machine. But at the same time, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi insist it’s not a theme park frozen in the past: They use olive oil, not typical of the era being evoked. “It fits with some of our dishes, but we’re also thrilled to be using ingredients that aren’t French or Italian, to be exploring a new genre,” Ms. Williams said. “We’re having a lot of fun.”",2021-12-21 16:04:58+00:00,"['Restaurants', 'Sodi, Rita', 'Williams, Jody (1963- )', 'Loi, Maria', 'Commerce Inn (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)']"

You might be tempted to invest in a wardrobe of these little Japanese pans (7.75 inches in diameter, two cup capacity) that are made in the Gifu region, between Tokyo and Osaka, and known for ceramics.",2021-12-27 17:13:59+00:00,"['Cookware', 'Museum of Modern Art']"

A Year of Shabbats in One Cookbook,Front Burner,"The start of a new year is as good a time as any to consult “52 Shabbats,” a cookbook that features a year of Friday night dinners. The Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashana) would be the most appropriate kickoff — that’s where the book begins its seasonal chapters — but it was not published until this month, so here we are. The author explains Shabbat, kosher food and the Jewish communities around the world that inspired the recipes, many featuring the elaborate spices or spice blends that are typical of places like Ethiopia, India and Mexico. Most of the featured recipes are for main dishes (notably for chicken and pot roasts), but there are also sides, desserts, basics and menu suggestions. A chicken and vegetable tagine, fish cakes inspired by India and fritters made from leftover challah are worth keeping.",2021-12-27 17:26:49+00:00,"['Rosh Hashana', 'Books and Literature', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']"
Preorder a French Galette des Rois,Front Burner,"In many countries the observance of Christmas stretches into January, culminating on Epiphany, Jan. 6, when Jesus Christ was said to have been revealed to the world through the agency of the Magi, the three kings. In France, the day has been commemorated for centuries with a delicious puff pastry cake filled with frangipane in which a fève, or bean, but sometimes a tiny porcelain figure, is buried, with the finder being crowned king or queen. French pastry shops throughout New York bake them, often in a large or individual size, and have them available through most of January. Ordering in advance is advised, and often required. This year, Cuis’in, a French caterer in Manhattan is updating theirs with fillings of matcha and chocolate, in addition to the traditional almond paste. They come with the fève on the side for the buyer to insert, and with a gilded paper crown for the king or queen. They can be ordered now for delivery to Manhattan starting Jan. 3; and to Brooklyn and Queens starting Jan. 6 and continuing until Jan. 30; nationwide shipping is also available. Mirjam Lavabre, the owner, said the galettes are so popular she plans to offer them year-round with other fillings like ginger and pomegranate.",2021-12-27 17:30:58+00:00,"['Pastries', 'Bakeries and Baked Products']"
